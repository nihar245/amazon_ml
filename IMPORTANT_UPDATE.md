# üö® IMPORTANT UPDATE - SMAPE Loss Function

## Critical Change Made (October 11, 2025)

**User Observation:** The training was using MSE/MAE but the competition evaluates on SMAPE!

### ‚ùå Previous Implementation (INCORRECT)
```python
# Training Loss: MSE (Mean Squared Error)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

# Monitoring: MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
train_mae = torch.abs(predictions - prices).mean()
```

**Problem:** Training optimized for MSE, but competition judges on SMAPE - mismatch!

---

### ‚úÖ Updated Implementation (CORRECT)

```python
# Training Loss: SMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
def smape_loss(predictions, targets, epsilon=1e-8):
    """Competition evaluation metric - now used as loss function"""
    denominator = (torch.abs(targets) + torch.abs(predictions)) / 2.0 + epsilon
    smape = torch.abs(predictions - targets) / denominator
    return torch.mean(smape) * 100  # Return as percentage

criterion = smape_loss
```

**Benefit:** Model now optimizes EXACTLY for the competition metric!

---

## Why This Matters

### SMAPE vs MSE Differences

| Aspect | MSE (Old) | SMAPE (New) ‚úÖ |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Formula** | (pred - actual)¬≤ | \|pred - actual\| / ((actual + pred)/2) |
| **Penalty** | Large errors heavily | Relative percentage errors |
| **Scale** | Absolute values | Percentage (0-200%) |
| **Bias** | Favors large prices | Treats all price ranges equally |
| **Competition** | Not used | **Official metric** |

### Example Impact

**Product: $10 actual price**
- Predict $8: MSE=4, SMAPE=22.2%
- Predict $12: MSE=4, SMAPE=18.2%

**Product: $100 actual price**
- Predict $80: MSE=400, SMAPE=22.2%
- Predict $120: MSE=400, SMAPE=18.2%

**With MSE:** Model focuses on expensive products (larger absolute errors)
**With SMAPE:** Model treats all price ranges fairly (relative errors)

## Changes Made to Code

### 1. train.py
```python
# Added SMAPE loss function (line 202-209)
def smape_loss(predictions, targets, epsilon=1e-8):
    """SMAPE loss - competition metric"""
    denominator = (torch.abs(targets) + torch.abs(predictions)) / 2.0 + epsilon
    smape = torch.abs(predictions - targets) / denominator
    return torch.mean(smape) * 100

# Changed criterion (line 217)
criterion = smape_loss  # Was: criterion = nn.MSELoss()

# Updated monitoring (line 273-274)
print(f"Train SMAPE: {train_loss:.2f}%")
print(f"Val SMAPE: {val_loss:.2f}%")

# Removed log transform (line 311)
# No need for log transform - SMAPE works well with raw prices
```

## Expected Results Update

### Old (MSE Loss)
```
Epoch 1/15
Train Loss: 1250.45, Train MAE: 25.67
Val Loss: 1387.23, Val MAE: 28.34
```

### New (SMAPE Loss) ‚úÖ
```
Epoch 1/15
Train SMAPE: 45.50%
Val SMAPE: 48.30%

Epoch 10/15
Train SMAPE: 18.25%
Val SMAPE: 22.15%
‚úì Model saved with Val SMAPE: 22.15%
```

**Target:** Val SMAPE < 25% (competitive performance)

---

## Impact on Your Results

### Before (MSE)
- Training optimized for absolute errors
- Biased toward expensive products
- Final SMAPE: Unknown until submission
- Potentially sub-optimal competition performance

### After (SMAPE) ‚úÖ
- Training optimized for SAME metric as competition
- Fair treatment across all price ranges
- You see SMAPE during training (know your score early)
- Better competition performance expected

---

## What You Need to Do

### Option 1: Re-train (Recommended for best results)
```bash
python train.py
# Will now show SMAPE scores during training
# Expected: Val SMAPE 18-25% (much better than before)
```

### Option 2: Use existing model
- Your existing model still works
- But was optimized for MSE, not SMAPE
- May perform worse on competition leaderboard

---

## Verification

After training with SMAPE loss, you should see:

```
Epoch 1/15
[Train] 100%|‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà| 1993/1993 [02:15<00:00, SMAPE: 45.23%]
[Val] 100%|‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà| 352/352 [00:18<00:00]

Train SMAPE: 45.50%
Val SMAPE: 48.30%
‚úì Model saved with Val SMAPE: 48.30%

...

Epoch 10/15
Train SMAPE: 18.25%
Val SMAPE: 22.15%
‚úì Model saved with Val SMAPE: 22.15%
```

**Good performance:** Val SMAPE < 25%
**Excellent performance:** Val SMAPE < 20%

## Technical Details

### Why SMAPE is Better for Price Prediction

1. **Scale-invariant:** $1 error on $10 item = $10 error on $100 item (percentage-wise)
2. **Symmetric:** Over-prediction and under-prediction penalized equally
3. **Bounded:** Always between 0% and 200% (easier to interpret)
4. **Competition-aligned:** Training metric = evaluation metric

### Numerical Stability

Added epsilon (1e-8) to prevent division by zero:
```python
denominator = (|actual| + |predicted|) / 2.0 + epsilon
```

This handles edge cases where both actual and predicted are ~0.

## Credit

**User feedback:** "shouldn't be the loss SMAPE, you are using the MAE"

Excellent observation! This change significantly improves the model's alignment with competition goals.

## Summary

‚úÖ **Training loss:** Now uses SMAPE (competition metric)
‚úÖ **Monitoring:** Shows SMAPE percentages during training
‚úÖ **Expected performance:** 18-25% Val SMAPE (competitive)
‚úÖ **Recommendation:** Re-train model with new loss function

**Updated:** October 11, 2025
**Reason:** Align training objective with competition evaluation metric
