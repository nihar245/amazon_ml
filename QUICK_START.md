# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Get Running in 5 Minutes

## ✅ What I've Built For You

A complete **multimodal ML solution** for Amazon ML Challenge 2025 that predicts product prices using:
- **Text features** from product descriptions (using MiniLM transformers)
- **Numeric features** extracted via regex (quantities, pack sizes, units)
- **Neural network** with 150K parameters that trains in ~30 minutes on Kaggle GPU

## 🎯 Three Ways to Run This Project

### Option 1: Kaggle GPU (⭐ RECOMMENDED - Fastest)

**Time:** 30-45 minutes total | **Cost:** Free

1. Go to https://www.kaggle.com/ and log in
2. Create new notebook, enable **GPU P100** accelerator
3. Upload your `train.csv` and `test.csv` to Kaggle Dataset
4. Copy-paste this code:

```python
# Setup
!git clone https://github.com/meethp1884/amazon_ai_chall_1.git
%cd amazon_ai_chall_1
!mkdir -p student_resource/dataset models
!cp /kaggle/input/YOUR_DATASET_NAME/*.csv student_resource/dataset/
!pip install sentence-transformers -q

# Train (30-45 minutes)
!python train.py

# Predict
!python sample_code.py

# Download results
from IPython.display import FileLink
FileLink('student_resource/dataset/test_out.csv')
```

**Done!** Download `test_out.csv` and submit to competition.

---

### Option 2: Google Colab GPU (Alternative to Kaggle)

**Time:** 30-45 minutes | **Cost:** Free

1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Create new notebook
3. Runtime → Change runtime type → **GPU (T4)**
4. Upload your dataset files to Colab or mount Google Drive
5. Run similar code as Kaggle above

---

### Option 3: Local Computer (CPU Only - Slow)

**Time:** 7-10 hours | **Cost:** Free but slow

Only use if you don't have internet access for Kaggle/Colab.

```bash
# In Command Prompt
cd C:\Users\meeth\OneDrive\Desktop\Amazon_ai_challenge

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train (7-10 hours on CPU)
python train.py

# Predict
python sample_code.py
```

**Output:** `student_resource\dataset\test_out.csv`

## 🎓 Training Configuration (Already Optimized)

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| **Epochs** | 10-15 | Prevents overfitting |
| **Early Stopping** | Patience=5 | Stops at best performance |
| **Batch Size** | 32 | Optimal for 8GB RAM |
| **Learning Rate** | 2e-4 | Conservative for fine-tuning |
| **Dropout** | 0.3→0.2→0.1 | Progressive regularization |

**You don't need to change these values** - they're already optimized!

## 🔧 Common Issues & Fixes

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'transformers'"
**Fix:** `pip install transformers sentence-transformers`

### "CUDA out of memory"
**Fix:** Reduce batch size to 16 or 8 in `train.py` line 365

### "Git push rejected - large files"
**Fix:** Already handled by `.gitignore` - datasets and models won't be pushed

### Training stuck at same loss
**Fix:** Normal for first few batches, wait 5 minutes. If still stuck, restart training.

### Predictions all similar values
**Fix:** Model didn't train properly. Check validation loss was decreasing.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Results
1. ✅ Use Kaggle/Colab GPU (30 mins vs 10 hours)
2. ✅ Don't modify training configuration (already optimized)
3. ✅ Let early stopping do its job (don't force more epochs)
4. ✅ Check validation loss is decreasing (sign of good training)

### What NOT to Do
1. ❌ Don't train for >20 epochs (overfitting)
2. ❌ Don't use batch size <8 (too slow, unstable)
3. ❌ Don't modify the base structure in `sample_code.py`
4. ❌ Don't push dataset files to GitHub (too large)
